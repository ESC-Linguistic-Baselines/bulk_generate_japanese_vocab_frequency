# What this Add-on Does

For those asking for the License permission, it's WTFPL. So please feel free to modify/re-upload a better version whenever you like.


•This Add-on will generate the frequency ranking for the provided japanese vocab field 
• The frequency ranking is generated from the same Frequency database of Rikai-Sama  firefox add-on (I asked for Permission from Rikai-Sama author)

# Usage Example
For example, if you have a card with the vocab "頬杖" then the frequency ranking of "14962" will be appended to the chosen destination field

What does this frequency number means?

•if a word has a frequency of 1563, it means that 1562 words are more frequent than it. 

•frequency number 1-5000 = very common, 5001-10000 = common, 10001-20000 = rare, 20001+ = very rare

•Frequencies are based on analysis of 5000+ novels. Naturally, frequency based on other mediums (such as newspapers) might vary. 

•Not all words have frequency information. It is possible for multiple words to share the same frequency
